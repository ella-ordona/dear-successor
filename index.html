When my co-worker and I started as Web Designers, we often didn’t feel like we could articulate what it was we had learned that day, week or even in that month. That’s because it sort of unveils itself to you in other ways-in new ways to solve a problem, or methodologies to keep on task, or how to ask a question differently. Sure, you’ll learn a lot about what it takes to keep a website going, but the good stuff, as most things are, is underneath that - in the details, in the process and with the people.

                                This is a pretty self-explanatory title, but I’ll come at it with some background. I arrived at ResTek with more of a design education - sure, I was a CS major, but nothing like some of the people already on the team: sharp, analytical, with uncanny abilities to write the least amount of code possible to solve a problem. I despaired; it seemed as if I was never going to be able to get to their level, no matter how much time I spent behind a computer.

                                If you feel like this, slightly intimidated by the people around you, fret not! For the glorious code review exists, and it is only meant to make you stronger as a programmer. Once we started applying code reviews to our sessions, I got feedback from everyone, and was able to change my code or argue my case, if needed. This also applies to those who fall into the category of those sharp, analytical and efficient programmers. Code reviews teach you to be observant and to be able to explain your reasoning behind your choices. It’s a win-win for everyone. Really lean into the code review portion of your work. It’s a great way to grow those technical skills.

                                Are you curious about a <a href="https://bulma.io/">new framework</a>? Did your design professor point out a <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/studio">prototyping tool</a> that you think would solve all of the problems the team is facing? Figure out a way to finally stop <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/burndown-charts">putting too little or too many tasks on the sprint</a>? That’s great! Share it with your team. I mean it - do your research and then present your case on how you think it would save hours on production time or make work more fun. ResTek thrives on the new technologies, methodologies, frameworks, video games, anime recommendations, etc. that are passed back and forth by its team. Not only that, but we prize the deep dive - the afternoon spent reading about conducting usability tests or React components is not viewed as time wasted. Never stop being curious here. It’s a valuable asset that is rewarding to everyone on the team.

                                If you feel like you’ve been banging your head on your keyboard for a couple hours and the stupid thing still won’t work the way you need it to, here’s a little something I’ve learned that fixes that almost immediately: stand up. Look out the window, at the ocean and the mountains. Contemplate the color of the sky and how fast weather changes here. Maybe talk to your co-workers about something interesting you read in the news that day. I guarantee, once you get back to your computer, you will either realize what the problem was almost immediately or you will have a fresh plan to tackle the problem. Sometimes, all you need is five minutes and a change of subject. But if that doesn’t work, here’s one that will:

                                This one is probably the most important one I’ve learned. Trust your team to support you, to listen to you, and take your ideas and solutions into consideration. They’ll be expecting the same thing of you. There’s going to be disagreements, and how gracefully you navigate those will depend on the level of trust you have. You know those teambuilding activities that you’re required to do every quarter? Actually engage at those.  Be honest with yourself and with others, and ask for help when you need it. Find the areas where certain team members excel and go to them for advice in those areas. Carve out your own area of expertise and share it with your team. Be empathetic and willing to compromise. Remember: trust is a two-way street.

                               I’ve worked in a lot of places: cafes, restaurants and one really swanky office building in downtown Seattle. ResTek has been, by far, the place where I’ve grown the most, both technically and interpersonally. My teammates have become my friends, and my managers my mentors (hi, Deborah! Thank you again for everything!). I’m very grateful and feel very lucky to have been able to be a part of it all.
